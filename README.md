React.js Template
========

##Objective
ReactJS Template / HelloWorld with React Router and css transitions

##Step 1: Set up a HelloWorld Component
HelloWorld component to make sure that I've tied everything together properly. 

 * Fork this repository then clone your fork
 * npm install the dependencies you'll need
 * Configure your .babelrc file
 * Configure your webpack.config.js file
 * Configure your index.html file
 * Configure your index.js file to render a HelloWorld component
 * Start webpack and make sure everything is working

##Step 2: Let React Router handle Routing

 * HelloWorld component in Main.js file (I have mine located in a containers folder)
 * Route configuration file setup to activate the Main component whenever a user hits the index '/' path of your app.
 * Also a 'return' button to route back to main from Example Component / Container
